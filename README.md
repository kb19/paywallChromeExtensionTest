This was created so I could learn how to create a Chrome extension as well as show how silly the implementation of some of these paywalls are (in this case on thestar.com). 
The content of an article is loaded and then a couple overlays are thrown over the page (presumably so the article is still searchable).

HOW TO USE
====================

1. Download this repository on the far right ('Download Zip') and unzip it
2. In Chrome, type 'chrome://extensions' into the address bar
3. In the top right, click the 'Developer Mode' checkbox (if it's not already checked)
3. Click on 'Load unpacked extension' and select the folder you downloaded this extension to
4. And voila! The extension will be activated whenever you hit an article on thestar.com
